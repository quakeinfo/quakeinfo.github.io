                                    individuals who experienced the recent earthquake in Turkey. The first interviewee
                                    found themselves trapped under the rubble for several hours, and tragically lost
                                    both of their parents who were in the same building. The second interviewee's home
                                    sustained significant damage and they are unsure if they will be able to continue
                                    living there. On top of that, they also lost their uncle and aunt in the earthquake.
                                    The stories of these two individuals offer a powerful perspective on the human
                                    impact of natural disasters, and remind us of the importance of earthquake
                                    preparedness and response efforts. <br><br>

                                    I looked for a place to hide directly. My sister was sleeping, I woke her up and I
                                    covered her in the fetal position, but it took a long time. I was sure that we were
                                    going to die. My mother and father, with the panic and fear at that moment, ran
                                    straight to the corridor and there was a popping sound from that side, I thought
                                    they were dead, I called but I couldn’t hear them because the rain and humming
                                    sounds were too loud. I couldn't go to their place because the earthquake didn't
                                    stop, and I thought I lost them. I have never experienced such a strong and long
                                    earthquake before. In short, there was panic, fear, desperation, and I thought that
                                    none of us could get out of here.</p>

                                <p><b> Q: </b>Did you suffer any physical or emotional injuries during the earthquake?
                                    How are you coping with them?</p>
                                <p><b> First interviewee: </b> There is a great emotional destruction, and I cannot cope
                                    with it for now. </p>
                                <p><b> Second interviewee: </b> I did not have any physical problems, but emotionally I
                                    was very shaken. The city where I was born and grew up is gone. The people I loved
                                    died. It is very difficult to cope with and I am still experiencing its effects, but
                                    life goes on. The idea of fulfilling my responsibilities fully so that no one will
                                    experience such a thing again for the remaining people is the biggest factor for me
                                    to cope.</p><br><br>

                                    challenges did you face?</p>
                                <p><b> First interviewee: </b> We took shelter in the car during the earthquake and
                                    could not find water or fuel.</p>
                                <p><b> Second interviewee: </b>We spent the first 30 hours in the car, and then we took
                                    shelter in my grandmother's house. The weather was very, very cold. At the time of
                                    the earthquake, we could not take anything with us because of fear. </p>

                                <p><b> First interviewee: </b> I can say that water, food and powerbank were top
                                    priority needs.</p>
                                <p><b> Second interviewee: </b> There was no food or water. Since the aid did not come
                                    for the first 2-3 days, we were fed with the products we could find. Hygiene was the
                                    biggest problem; it was very difficult to find water and hygiene products. We
                                    experienced hygiene difficulties such as not being able to take a shower, brushing
                                    teeth, not even washing hands. Since there was no electricity, we could not
                                    communicate with the outside world, especially due to the charging problems of the
                                    phones. We were worried about the people we could not hear from, and we could not
                                    convey our needs. In addition, heating was one of the serious problems since there
                                    was no natural gas and electricity.</p><br><br>

                                <p><b> First interviewee: </b> There are people willing to help me with my future and my
                                    career. Also, they are of course psychologically supporting me but we have not
                                    gotten any professional help yet.</p>

                                </p>
                                <p><b> First interviewee: </b> I would not live in a country that is prone to
                                    earthquakes. I am planning to live in a city or country in which there is a lower
                                    risk of an earthquake</p>
                                <p><b> Second interviewee: </b>First, I would have my house, where I live, checked by a
                                    specialist and take the necessary precautions according to his ideas. I would learn
                                    more detailed information about the triangle of life.I would prepare an earthquake
                                    bag for it and put it right next to my bed or in our car.</p><br><br>

                                    it is going to help.</p>
                                <p><b> Second interviewee: </b> I think psychological support is one of my biggest
                                    needs. For us, life has come to a standstill since the earthquake. We need the
                                    realization that life goes on and the hope that things can get better again, even if
                                    they are not the same as before. Yes, it will be difficult, but we need to get
                                    involved in social life, return to our responsibilities, schools and jobs that will
                                    make us forget the earthquake even a little bit.</p><br><br>

                                <p><b> First interviewee: </b> Not to give consolation and not to say that it is going
                                    to be okay. Sometimes just being there to share your pain is enough</p>
                                <p><b> Second interviewee: </b> Showing that they are with me. Knowing that there is
                                    someone I can trust when I seek financial or moral support really helps. But they
                                    should do it without hurting people they should not say that It could be worse</p>

                                <p><b> Second interviewee: </b> It is a complete shame. People's families, loved ones,
                                    cities have disappeared. We beg our state, to which we have paid earthquake tax for
                                    years, to meet our basic needs for living and shelter. We waited for days for the
                                    rescue teams. We were desperate. Yes, it was a great natural disaster, the state
                                    failed to execute the process correctly. First, the government had to mobilize all
                                    its resources and be much better prepared for such a disaster. Because it was
                                    already known that the place, we live in is an earthquake zone.</p><br><br>

                                    and building proper and earthquake resistant buildings.</p>
                                <p><b> Second interviewee: </b> Earthquake is not an event that can be prevented, but we
                                    must learn to live with it and take measures against it. Houses should be made
                                    stronger. And no matter what, you should not move during the earthquake, you should
                                    sleep with the phone next to you.</p>
